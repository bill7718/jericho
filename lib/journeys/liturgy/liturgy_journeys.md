## User Journeys for Liturgy

In common with all Service Items the system does not ask the user to split the Liturgy on to separate pages. This is done automatically by the application.

### Add Liturgy


The Add Liturgy Journey runs as follows
- The system asks for a name for the Liturgy (e.g. Confession)
  - The system validates the name for duplicates
- The system asks for the text of the liturgy 
- The system shows a preview of how the liturgy will be displayed
- Finally the system creates the liturgy on the database
